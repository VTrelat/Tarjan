# Mines Nancy — Research Project — _Vincent Trélat_

> ## Introduction
>
> This repository was created as part of my research project at Mines de Nancy, supervised by [Stephan Merz](https://members.loria.fr/Stephan.Merz/). The objective of the project is to mechanize a proof of correctness of a set-based algorithm inspired by Tarjan's algorithm for computing the strongly connected components of a graph. The algorithm is detailed in [Vincent Bloemen's thesis](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/122499728/thesis.pdf) and a few invariants are described.

> ## Formal methods
>
> The formal proof is written is [Isabelle(HOL)](https://isabelle.in.tum.de). I also wrote a LaTeX paper [on the proof](/LaTeX/report.pdf).

---

> ## Model Checking
>
> A TLA+ model for checking our invariants is provided in [here](/tla).
