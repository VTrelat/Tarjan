* This git repository contains my personal implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for the strongly connected components problem.
* The algorithm is implemented in __Java__, see ```Graph.java``` for the actual SCC algorithm and compile/execute ```Main.java```.
* Graphs are represented through the adjency list of each node, _i.e._ if nodes are numbered from _0_ to _n-1_, then for _i_ in _[0, n-1]_, `adjency[i]` is the list of nodes to which node i is connected.
